# Time-dependent Zermelo navigation with tacking
This repository contains the implementation for computing pregeodesics for a time-dependent metric as well as computing tack-curves, where it is possible to change metric along the curve.

## Installation and Requirements

The implementations in the GitHub is Python using JAX. To clone the GitHub reporsitory and install packages type the following in the terminal

```
git clone https://github.com/FrederikMR/georce.git
cd georce
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The first line clones the repository, the second line moves you to the location of the files, while the last line install the packages used in repository.

## Code Structure

The following shows the structure of the code. All general implementations of geometry and optimization algorithms can be found in the "geometry" folder for both the Riemannian and Finsler case.

    ├── geometry                           # Contains implementation of Finsler and Riemannian manifolds as well as geodesic optimization algorithms, inlcuding GEORCE
    ├── georce                             # A folder containing the GEORCE algorithm for Finsler and Riemannian manifolds that can be directly used in your application
    └── README.md

## Reproducing Experiments

All experiments can be re-produced by running the notebooks and the runtime.py package for the given manifold, hyper-parameters and optimization method.

## Logging

All experimental results for the runtime and length estimates are saved as .pkl files in the folder "timing".

## How to use GEORCE to compute your geodesics

If you want to clone this repository and use GEORCE to compute geodesics for your manifolds, then the folder "georce" contains implementations of GEORCE in JAX for Riemannian and Finsler manifolds, which takes any given metric as input. The notebook, georce_example.ipynb, illustrates how to compute geodesics using GEORCE.
